                        If your dog has webbed feet, the membranes between its toes are still intact. Webbed feet are
                        the result of mutations in the genes that would normally cause this tissue to die before birth,
                        separating the digits from each other. In some cases, a dog might not undergo this process
                        before it is born, giving rise to a dog with webbed feet.

                        A practical guideline is that puppies should be fed three times a day from weaning (3 to 6
                        weeks) to 4 months of age. After 4 months, they should be fed twice a day. Most dogs should
                        continue to be fed twice a day throughout their life, although some pets do well with one
                        feeding.

                <a data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#faq4" class="collapsed">What should I do if my dog is constipated or

                <div id="faq4" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind that the pet's stool should be small and firm. Most cases of constipation are
                        temporary and due to dietary interruptions. Loose stools also are often temporary and can be due
                        to dietary interruptions, as well as many other things, including an abrupt change in diet,
                        overeating, parasites, medication, eating table scraps, viral or bacterial infections, and
                        stress. If constipation or diarrhea persists, however, it is important to consult a
                        veterinarian.

                        The amount to feed depends on the age, size, and activity level of the dog. Feeding guidelines,
                        which list the daily recommended portion, are included on all of our packages. Start feeding
                        with this amount and adjust according to your pet's needs. Remember to divide the portion
                        accordingly if you feed more than once a day.

                        Cats and dogs have different nutritional requirements and really should not eat each other's
                        food. For example, cats require a much higher level of taurine in their diet. An occasional
                        venture into each other's bowls will not be harmful, but is not recommended on a regular basis.
